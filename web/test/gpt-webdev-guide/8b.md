### 8b: Introduction to Node.js and Express

Welcome to the Introduction to Node.js and Express, two critical technologies in modern back-end web development. Having covered front-end technologies and the basics of the server and client interaction in previous sections, we will now delve into the specifics of building server-side applications using Node.js with the Express framework.

#### What is Node.js?

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, known for its speed and efficiency. Unlike traditional web-serving techniques where each connection spawns a new thread, consuming system RAM and becoming inefficient for high loads, Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop. This non-blocking I/O model makes Node.js lightweight and efficient, ideal for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

#### Core Features of Node.js

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, meaning a Node.js-based server never waits for an API to return data and moves on to another API after calling it.
- **Single-Threaded**: Although JavaScript executes on the single thread, Node.js can be scaled to run multiple instances and to handle concurrency via its event loop and various modules.
- **Cross-Platform**: Node.js is cross-platform, allowing it to run on a variety of operating systems such as Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.
- **Package Management with NPM**: Node.js comes with the npm package manager, giving you access to thousands of libraries that can be easily imported into your project.

#### Setting Up Node.js

Before we can start using Node.js, we must install it. You can download the installer from the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/. It is recommended to use the LTS (Long Term Support) version for the best stability. Once installed, you can check the versions of Node.js and npm (node package manager) by executing the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

#### Creating a Simple Node.js Server

Let's build a simple Node.js server to illustrate how Node.js handles HTTP requests:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

Here, we're using Node.js's built-in `http` module to create a server that listens on port 3000. When we visit 'http://127.0.0.1:3000' in a web browser, it responds with 'Hello World'.

#### What is Express.js?

Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

Express simplifies the server creation process that is already available in Node.js, and provides many powerful features and utilities to enhance the web development process.

#### Core Features of Express.js

- **Middleware**: Functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.
- **Routing**: Express provides an advanced routing mechanism that helps to keep your application modular and flexible.
- **Templating**: With template engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars, you can build dynamic content on the server before sending a static HTML file to the browser.

#### Creating an Express Server

To start using Express, you must first install it using npm:

```bash
npm install express --save
```

Now, let's rewrite our previous Node.js server using Express:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World with Express.js'));

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Here, the `app.get()` method specifies a callback that will be invoked whenever there is an HTTP GET request with a path ('/') relative to the site root.

#### Middlewares in Express

Express middlewares are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server. Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response objects, and can modify them, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware in the stack.

Here’s an example of a simple middleware:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Time:', Date.now());
    next();
});
```

This middleware simply prints the current time for every request that is made to the server and then passes control to the next middleware in line.

#### Conclusion

Node.js and Express form a powerful pair for back-end development, which allows you to build fast, scalable network applications that can handle many simultaneous client requests. With the knowledge of front-end technologies and this introduction to the server side, we’re well on our way to the realms of full-stack development.

In the next sections, we'll dive deeper into Node.js and Express, exploring databases, server-side storage, and the creation of RESTful APIs.
