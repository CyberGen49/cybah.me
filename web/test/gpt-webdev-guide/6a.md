### 6a: Git Fundamentals

Welcome to Section 6a of our in-depth online course on web development. By now, you have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the core building blocks of the web. As you start building more complex projects, efficient management of your code becomes essential. This is where Git, a distributed version control system, plays a pivotal role. In this section, we will explore Git's fundamental concepts and commands that will enable you to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your development projects effectively.

#### What is Git?

Git is a free and open-source version control system designed to handle projects of any size with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicting changes. By tracking the history of modifications, Git enables the ability to revert back to previous states of a project, review changes, and collaborate with others.

#### Installing Git

Before we dive into using Git, make sure it's installed on your machine. You can download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). Choose the version compatible with your operating system and follow the installation prompts. Once installed, you can verify the installation by opening your command line or terminal and running:

```sh
git --version
```

You should see the version number of Git displayed, signifying its successful installation.

#### Setting Up Git

Post-installation, it's crucial to set up your Git environment. Start with configuring your username and email address, as these will be associated with your commits:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

#### Basic Git Workflow

Your Git workflow will generally follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Git repository**: Turn an existing directory into a Git repository or clone an existing repository.

To initialize a repository, navigate to your project's directory and run:

```sh
git init
```

2. **Check the status of your repository**: It's important to frequently monitor the state of your project with:

```sh
git status
```

3. **Staging changes**: Before you can record changes to the repository, you need to stage them using:

```sh
git add <filename>
```

or, to stage all changes:

```sh
git add .
```

4. **Committing changes**: To save a snapshot of your staged changes, you commit them:

```sh
git commit -m "A descriptive message about the changes"
```

5. **View commit history**: To see the logged history of commits use:

```sh
git log
```

#### Understanding Git Branches

Branches in Git allow you to diverge from the main line of development and work independently without affecting the main line. By default, Git starts with a single branch called `master` (or `main` in recent versions). To create a new branch:

```sh
git branch <branch-name>
```

To switch to the branch:

```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
```

And to merge a branch back into the master:

```sh
git checkout master
git merge <branch-name>
```

#### Git Remotes

When working with Git, you often need to manage your codebase on a remote server. Services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket provide remote servers. To add a remote repository:

```sh
git remote add origin <remote-repository-URL>
```

You can push your local commits to the remote server with:

```sh
git push origin master
```

And pull changes from the remote server with:

```sh
git pull origin master
```

#### Summary

This section covered the absolute basics of what Git is and the fundamental commands to start using it for version control. By leveraging Git in your development workflows, you can ensure that all your code changes are tracked, revertible, and secure. Keep practicing the commands covered here, as proficiency in Git is a crucial skill for web developers and will be extensively used in collaborative environments.
