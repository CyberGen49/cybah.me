### 3e: Advanced CSS: Flexbox and Grid

Welcome to the section on advanced CSS! By now, you should have a solid understanding of basic CSS concepts, including selectors, properties, the box model, and responsive design principles. In this section, we will delve into two potent layout models that are fundamental to modern web design: Flexbox and Grid.

#### Introduction to Flexbox

Flexbox, officially known as the Flexible Box Layout Module, is a one-dimensional layout model for arranging elements in rows or columns within a container. It makes the creation of complex layouts simple and is responsive by nature. With Flexbox, you can control the size, order, and alignment of elements with just a few lines of code.

To start using Flexbox, you'll need to define a container element with the display property set to `flex` or `inline-flex`. Once defined, immediate child elements of the container become flex items, which you can align and distribute with ease.

**Example:**
```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Aligns items horizontally */
  align-items: center; /* Aligns items vertically */
}
```

#### Flex Container Properties

Flexbox provides several properties you can apply to the container to control the layout of flex items:

- `flex-direction`: Defines the main axis as either row or column.
- `justify-content`: Aligns items along the main axis (horizontal if `flex-direction` is row).
- `align-items`: Aligns items along the cross axis (vertical if `flex-direction` is row).
- `flex-wrap`: Allows items to wrap onto multiple lines or to stay on a single line.
- `align-content`: Aligns the flex lines within the container (when there's extra space on the cross axis).

#### Flex Item Properties

Child elements of a flex container—flex items—also have specific properties you can use:

- `flex-grow`: Defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary.
- `flex-shrink`: Allows a flex item to shrink if required.
- `flex-basis`: Sets the initial size of a flex item before any available space is distributed.
- `order`: Changes the order in which the item appears in the flex container, overriding the source order.
- `align-self`: Allows individual flex items to be aligned differently compared to others using `align-items`.

#### Introduction to CSS Grid

The CSS Grid Layout Module provides a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that offers even more control than Flexbox. It allows you to create complex designs and layouts that were difficult to implement with older CSS methods.

To use CSS Grid, you similarly start by declaring a container element with the display property set to `grid` or `inline-grid`.

**Example:**
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  gap: 10px;
}
```

#### Grid Container Properties

CSS Grid features a wealth of properties that enable the definition and manipulation of the grid structure:

- `grid-template-columns` & `grid-template-rows`: Define the columns and rows of the grid with specific sizes.
- `gap`: Determines the space between grid items (both rows and columns).
- `justify-items` & `align-items`: Aligns grid items inside their grid area along the respective axis.
- `grid-auto-flow`: Controls how auto-placed items get inserted in the grid.

#### Grid Item Properties

With Grid, you also have control over the child items:

- `grid-column-start` & `grid-column-end`: Determines where a grid item starts and ends within the grid columns.
- `grid-row-start` & `grid-row-end`: Determines where a grid item starts and ends within the grid rows.
- `grid-area`: A shorthand for setting all four grid-* properties at once.
- `justify-self` & `align-self`: Aligns a grid item inside its cell.

#### Combining Flexbox and Grid

Understanding when to use Flexbox or Grid is essential. Flexbox is the go-to for one-dimensional layouts, where you're dealing with a linear set of elements, such as navigation bars or item lists. Grid is best suited for two-dimensional layouts, where you need more control over both rows and columns, like complex web page layouts.

In practical application, Flexbox and Grid can work hand in hand. You might use Grid to layout the major sections of a webpage and then use Flexbox for the content within those sections, empowering you with the flexibility and control needed at each level of your design.

#### Practice Examples

Let's apply our knowledge with some practice examples. Try creating a navigation bar with Flexbox, ensuring the navigation items are equally spaced and centered. Next, create a photo gallery using Grid with responsive columns that adjust based on screen size. Remember to consider fallbacks for older browsers when using these advanced layout models.

By mastering Flexbox and Grid, you're now well-equipped to tackle nearly any layout challenge. Keep experimenting with these tools, and use developer resources like MDN Web Docs to explore all the properties and values. With these advanced CSS techniques in your arsenal, there's no design you can't bring to life.
