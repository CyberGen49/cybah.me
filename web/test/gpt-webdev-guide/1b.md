### 1b: Understanding the Internet and How Websites Work

Welcome back to our in-depth online course on web development. In this section, "Understanding the Internet and How Websites Work," we'll unravel the mystery behind how the numerous websites you interact with every day are delivered to your computer or mobile device. This knowledge is not only fascinating but also foundational for your journey as a web developer.

#### The Internet and Its Origins
At its core, the Internet is a vast network of computers all connected by cables and wireless signals. It started as a project named ARPANET in the late 1960s, which was funded by the US Department of Defense. The original intent was to share information and resources among computers.

#### How Data Travels Across the Internet
Data travels across the Internet in packets. Each packet contains a small piece of data, and they are all routed from the source to the destination using various protocols, primarily the Internet Protocol (IP). Think of it as sending a letter through the postal service, where the letter is divided into smaller envelopes (packets), each finding its way to your mailbox (the destination).

#### IP Addresses and Domain Names
Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address. An IP address is a series of numbers that identify a particular device. Because remembering numbers can be difficult, domain names were created. A domain name is the human-readable address that you type into a browser's address bar, such as `www.example.com`.

#### DNS: The Internet's Phonebook
The Domain Name System (DNS) converts domain names into IP addresses. This is needed because while domain names are easier for people to remember, computers and networks require IP addresses to route the packets correctly.

#### Web Servers and Hosting
A web server is a computer that hosts websites and serves their content to users. When you intend to make a website accessible to other people, you will need to host it on a server that is always connected to the Internet. The server stores your website's files and data and serves them to users' browsers upon request.

#### HTTP and HTTPS
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web, and it's a protocol used for transmitting HTML documents. When a user requests a webpage, the request is sent to the server using HTTP. The server then responds with the requested page, also via HTTP. HTTPS (with the "S" standing for Secure) is an encrypted version of HTTP, ensuring secure communication over the network.

#### How Browsers Render Websites
Web browsers are the tools users employ to access websites. They request web pages from servers, interpret the code (HTML, CSS, and JS), and render it to display the page. The process of rendering a page includes fetching resources, parsing HTML to build the DOM (Document Object Model), applying CSS to style it, and executing JavaScript to add interactive features.

#### The Request-Response Cycle
When you type a web address or click a link, you initiate the request-response cycle. Your browser sends a request to the server, which then processes that request. If the requested resource is available, the server responds with the resource and a status code (like 200 for success or 404 for not found), and then your browser renders the page on your device.

#### Website Development Process
Developing a website involves a series of steps—planning, designing, coding, testing, and deploying. Each step has its own set of best practices. As a web developer, you'll often find yourself going back and forth between these steps, iterating your design and code until it meets the desired requirements.

#### Conclusion
Understanding the principles of how the Internet and websites work is crucial. It gives you the context you need to make decisions down the road—aspects like choosing the right hosting, optimizing for performance, and ensuring robust security become much clearer when you know how the underlying technology functions.

Setting a solid foundation in web technologies will significantly benefit your learning journey. With this understanding, you can now move on to the more technical aspects of web development, starting with setting up your development environment in the next section.

In the next part of this series, we'll dive into "Setting Up a Development Environment" where you'll learn about the tools and software you need to start developing your own websites.
