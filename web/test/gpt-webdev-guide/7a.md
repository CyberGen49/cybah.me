### 7a: Introduction to React

Welcome to section 7 of our in-depth online course on web development. In this segment, we will delve into one of the most popular and influential front-end frameworks in the industry today: React. Developed by Facebook in 2013, React has rapidly become a cornerstone technology for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

#### What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for constructing user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. React’s key feature is the ability to construct components, encapsulating elements of the UI as reusable and composable pieces.

#### React's Key Features

- **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.

- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: We don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

- **Virtual DOM (Document Object Model)**: React maintains a lightweight representation of the real DOM in memory, known as the virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it calculates the differences and then updates the real DOM only where changes have occurred.

#### JSX - JavaScript XML

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX might remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript. React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

#### React Components

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. Components can be defined as JavaScript functions or classes.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

#### State and Lifecycle

React components can have state by setting `this.state` in their constructors. `this.state` should be considered as private to a React component that it’s defined in. When the state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

```jsx
class Timer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {seconds: 0};
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      seconds: state.seconds + 1
    }));
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Seconds: {this.state.seconds}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

#### Handling Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. However, there are some syntax differences:

- React event handlers are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
- With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

```jsx
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

#### Combining Components

Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name="Edite" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### React Hooks

Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8 that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. The most used hooks are `useState` for adding state to functional components and `useEffect` for performing side effects in function components.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Conclusion

This introduction has given you a brief overview of what makes React so popular and powerful for building user interfaces. As we proceed with the curriculum, we will dive into React's APIs, learn about state management, routing, and build more complex applications. We will also explore the ecosystem surrounding React, including tooling, libraries, and best practices. Keep coding and get ready to react to React!
