### 2c: Creating Forms and Tables

Forms and tables are fundamental elements for structuring content and facilitating user interactions on the web. This section will guide you through the process of creating functional HTML forms for collecting user input and organizing data with tables for easy consumption.

#### HTML Forms
A form in HTML is a section of a document that contains form elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, and more. Forms are used to gather data from users, which can then be processed by a back-end system.

##### The `<form>` Element
The container for form elements is the `<form>` tag. This tag supports attributes like `action`, defining the URL to which the form's data is sent when submitted, and `method`, which specifies how the data should be transferred (commonly `get` or `post`).

```html
<form action="submit_form.php" method="post">
  <!-- Form elements go here -->
</form>
```

##### Text Input Fields
Text fields allow users to input text. They are created using the `<input>` element with a `type` attribute set to `text`.

```html
<input type="text" name="username" id="username" placeholder="Enter your username">
```

Here, `name` is the identifier for this input when the form is submitted, `id` is unique identifier for the element, and `placeholder` provides a hint about what should be entered in the text box.

##### Password Fields
Similarly, password fields are text fields that mask the input. You can create a password field by setting the `type` attribute of the `<input>` element to `password`.

```html
<input type="password" name="password" id="password" placeholder="Enter your password">
```

##### Radio Buttons and Checkboxes
Radio buttons and checkboxes allow users to select options. Radio buttons (`type="radio"`) let users select one option from a set, while checkboxes (`type="checkbox"`) allow for multiple selections.

```html
<input type="radio" name="gender" id="male" value="male">
<label for="male">Male</label>
<input type="radio" name="gender" id="female" value="female">
<label for="female">Female</label>

<input type="checkbox" name="interest" id="coding" value="coding">
<label for="coding">Coding</label>
```

##### Submit Button
Submit buttons are created with the `<input>` element where the `type` is set to `submit`. When clicked, it sends the form data to the server.

```html
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
```

##### Labels
Labels are associated with form elements using the `for` attribute, which matches the `id` of the corresponding input. Labels provide better user accessibility by allowing users to click on the label text to focus the associated input field.

```html
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" name="username" id="username">
```

#### HTML Tables
Tables display data in a grid-like format of rows and columns. To create a table, we use several specific HTML elements.

##### The `<table>` Element
This element acts as the container for your table and encompasses all other table-specific elements.

```html
<table>
  <!-- Table rows, cells, and other elements go here -->
</table>
```

##### Table Rows
The `<tr>` element defines a row in a table. You can add as many `<tr>` elements to a `<table>` as needed.

```html
<tr>
  <!-- Table cells go here -->
</tr>
```

##### Table Header Cells
Table header cells, created using the `<th>` element, are typically used to denote column or row headers.

```html
<tr>
  <th>Header 1</th>
  <th>Header 2</th>
</tr>
```

##### Table Data Cells
The `<td>` element holds the data for a single table cell:

```html
<tr>
  <td>Data 1</td>
  <td>Data 2</td>
</tr>
```

##### Combining Rows and Cells
An entire table is composed by combining these rows and cells together appropriately.

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 1</td>
    <td>Data 2</td>
  </tr>
  <!-- More rows and cells as required -->
</table>
```

By mastering the use of forms and tables, you can greatly enhance the structure and interactivity of web pages, enabling more engaging user experiences. Remember to consider accessibility and usability practices, ensuring that your forms and tables are easy to navigate and understand for all users.
