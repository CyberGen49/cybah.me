# GPT's Guide to Web Development
I had GPT-4 Turbo generate a full web development course using the prompt in <prompt.txt>. The only thing that changed between prompts is the `SECTION_PLACEHOLDER` text.

See <generate.js> for details. This script takes a single command-line argument, which is a comma-separated list of sections (number and letter) to be generated and saved to their respective Markdown files. In theory, this allows for the entire course to be regenerated.
