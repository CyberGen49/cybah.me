### 1d: Introduction to Git and Version Control

Welcome to Section 1d of the course, where we will delve into the concept of version control using Git. Even if you are new to programming, you may have heard about Git as it has become an industry standard for managing the evolution of code.

### What is Version Control?

Version control systems (VCSs) are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. They keep track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to other team members.

### Why Use Version Control?

Version control is essential for several reasons:

- **Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work safely on the same project without fear of conflict.
- **Tracking:** Keeping a history of who did what and when helps unravel issues or understand decision making.
- **Experimentation:** Developers can attempt different strategies in parallel using branches, and only merge the successful ones.
- **Reversibility:** The ability to revert to previous states can save enormous amounts of time when something goes wrong.

### Git Basics

Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.

#### Git Terminology:

- **Repository (repo):** A folder that is tracked by Git, containing your project and its history.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of the repository at a given time. Each commit holds a description of what changed and a unique identifier.
- **Branch:** A separate working version of the code. The default branch is usually called 'main' or 'master'.
- **Merge:** The process of taking changes from one branch and integrating them into another.
- **Clone:** A copy of an existing Git repository.
- **Fork:** A personal copy of someone else's project. This allows you to freely experiment without affecting the original project.

#### Setting Up Git

Assuming you have already set up your development environment earlier in the course, installing Git in your system should have been part of the process. If not, [visit the official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the instructions for your operating system.

#### Configuring Git

Once installed, open a terminal or command prompt and configure Git with your name and email address. This information will be included with your commits.

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```

#### Creating a New Repository

To initialize a new Git repository in your project folder, navigate to your project folder in your command line tool and use the `git init` command. 

```sh
cd /path/to/your-project
git init
```

This command should create a hidden folder named `.git` in your project directory that will store all the necessary metadata for version control.

#### Basic Git Workflow

Here is a simple workflow on a day-to-day basis:

1. **Pull Changes:** Start by pulling in the latest changes from the remote repository to ensure you're working with the most recent version.

    ```sh
    git pull origin main
    ```

2. **Stage Changes:** After making changes to your code, you'll want to stage the changes, which means marking the modified files you want to be included in the next commit.

    ```sh
    git add <filename>
    ```

   Or to stage all changed files:

    ```sh
    git add .
    ```

3. **Commit Changes:** Committing is the process of saving the staged changes along with a descriptive message.

    ```sh
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```

4. **Push Changes:** To share your commits with the remote repository, you'll need to push them.

    ```sh
    git push origin main
    ```

### Introduction to Git and Version Control

This marks the end of Section 1d. You now have an essential understanding of what Git is, why version control is necessary, and how to set up and start using Git for your own projects. Practice these concepts and get comfortable with the basic commands. Later in the course, during Section 6, we will revisit Git and go in-depth on advanced topics such as branching strategies, resolving merge conflicts, and collaboration in teams.
