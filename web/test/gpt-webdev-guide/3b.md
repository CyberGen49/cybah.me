### 3b: Selectors, Properties, and Values

Having introduced you to the world of CSS and its capabilities to style HTML documents, it's time we dive deeper into the aspects that form the backbone of CSS: selectors, properties, and values. In this section, we will explore how to target HTML elements and apply styles to manipulate their appearance to fit your desired website aesthetic. Understanding the relationship between selectors, properties, and values is essential for mastering CSS.

#### CSS Selectors

Selectors are the means by which we target HTML elements to style them using CSS. Each selector points to an HTML element and allows us to apply a set of styles to that specific element or a group of elements. There are several types of selectors:
1. **Type Selectors**: target elements by their tag name. Example: `body`, `h1`, `p`.
   ```css
   p {
       color: blue;
   }
   ```
2. **Class Selectors**: target elements with a specific `class` attribute. Class selectors are prefixed with a period `.`. Example: `.alert`, `.container`.
   ```css
   .alert {
       background-color: red;
       color: white;
   }
   ```
3. **ID Selectors**: target an element with a specific `id` attribute. ID selectors are prefixed with a hash `#`. IDs must be unique within a document. Example: `#header`, `#footer`.
   ```css
   #header {
       background-color: #333;
       color: #fff;
   }
   ```
4. **Attribute Selectors**: target elements based on the presence or value of attributes. Example: `[type='text']`, `[href]`.
   ```css
   input[type='text'] {
       border: 1px solid #000;
   }
   ```
5. **Pseudo-class Selectors**: target elements in a specific state, such as `:hover`, `:focus`, `:checked`.
   ```css
   a:hover {
       text-decoration: underline;
   }
   ```
6. **Pseudo-element Selectors**: target specific parts of an element, such as `::first-letter`, `::after`.
   ```css
   p::first-letter {
       font-size: 200%;
       font-weight: bold;
   }
   ```
7. **Combinators**: combine other selectors in a variety of ways to target elements within the HTML hierarchy. For example, descendant (space), child (`>`), adjacent sibling (`+`), and general sibling (`~`) combinators.
   ```css
   div > p {
       margin-left: 20px;
   }
   ```

#### CSS Properties and Values

Each selector can be associated with a declaration block, which contains one or more declarations separated by a semicolon. A declaration itself consists of a property and a value, separated by a colon. Here is the structure of a basic rule set:

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

- **Properties**: These are the aspects of the selected element that you want to change. For example, `color`, `margin`, `border`, and `width` are all CSS properties.
  
- **Values**: These define the settings for the properties you've chosen. For example, if the property is `color`, the value might be `blue`, `#0000FF`, `rgb(0, 0, 255)`, or `rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)`.

Here are some examples of declarations with properties and values:

```css
body {
    background-color: #f8f8f8;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
    font-weight: bold;
}

nav {
    border: 1px solid #ddd;
    padding: 10px;
}
```

Understanding properties and values is crucial because it allows you to design web pages according to your vision. With properties and values, you can control virtually every visual aspectâ€”from layouts to typography, colors, and even animations and transitions.

#### Compound Values

Some properties can take multiple values, also known as compound values. For instance, the `border` property can accept values for border width, style, and color all at once:

```css
p {
    border: 1px solid #000;
}
```

This is equivalent to setting the following individual properties:

```css
p {
    border-width: 1px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: #000;
}
```

Compound values allow for more concise and readable code.

#### Conclusion

Selectors are how we pinpoint specific elements to style them, properties are what we want to change about those elements, and values are the exact changes we want to apply. Mastering the use of selectors, understanding properties, and correctly defining values are fundamental to becoming proficient in CSS.
