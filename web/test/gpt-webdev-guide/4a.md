### 4a: JavaScript Syntax and Statements

Welcome back to our in-depth online course on web development! Having built a solid understanding of HTML and CSS, it's time to add interactive elements to your web pages using JavaScript. In this section, we will explore the syntax and statements of JavaScript, laying a foundation for dynamic web development.

#### Understanding JavaScript Syntax

JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. When you see web pages doing more than just displaying static information—such as interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.—you can bet JavaScript is probably involved.

First, let’s review some general programming concepts that JavaScript uses:

- **Statements**: In JavaScript, a statement is a line of code that performs a specific task. For example, `document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello World!';` is a statement that finds an HTML element with the id 'demo' and changes its content to 'Hello World!'.

- **Expressions**: An expression is any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a single value. For instance, `5 * 10` evaluates to `50`.

- **Operators**: JavaScript includes arithmetic operators (like `+` and `-`), assignment operators (like `=`), comparison operators (like `==` or `===`), logical operators (like `&&` and `||`), and more.

- **Variables**: Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values). In JavaScript we declare variables using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword.

Here's a simple syntax overview:

```javascript
// Declaring a variable
let message;

// Assigning a value to the variable
message = 'Hello, World!';

// Declaring a variable with an initial value
let greeting = 'Welcome to JavaScript';

// Displaying a message in the console
console.log(greeting);
```

#### Writing Statements

JavaScript is executed in various environments, but most commonly on web browsers. Each statement should be on a new line and ended with a semicolon (`;`). Although semicolons are technically optional in JavaScript, it is a good practice to include them to avoid potential issues.

Here's a sequence of statements:

```javascript
let userName = 'Alice';
let age = 25;
console.log(`Hello, my name is ${userName} and I am ${age} years old`);
```

#### Using Comments

Comments are an essential part of programming. They are used to explain what certain parts of your code do, which is especially helpful when looking back at your code after some time or when others are reading your code. Comments in JavaScript are created using `//` for a single line comment, or `/* */` for a multi-line comment.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment

/*
This is a multi-line comment
which spans across multiple lines
*/
```

#### Understanding Conditional Statements

Conditional statements control the flow of the code based on certain conditions. The `if` statement is the most basic one:

```javascript
if (age > 18) {
  console.log('You are an adult!');
} else {
  console.log('You are not an adult.');
}
```

#### Looping Through Code

Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return `true` or `false`. A very commonly used loop is the `for` loop:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(`This is loop iteration number ${i+1}`);
}
```

This loop will print out the string five times, with the iteration number incrementing by 1 each time.

In conclusion, understanding the syntax and statements in JavaScript is crucial for building dynamic and interactive web pages. We've covered the basics here, and as you progress through the course, you'll become more familiar and comfortable with writing and using JavaScript in your web development projects. In the next section, we'll dive deeper into how we can use JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to make our web pages more interactive.
