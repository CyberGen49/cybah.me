### 10a: Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

Welcome to the session on Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)! By now, you have a solid foundation in web development, having studied topics from simple HTML to complex full-stack applications. In this section, we dive into the exciting world of PWAs, which are transforming the way users interact with websites on mobile devices.

#### What are Progressive Web Apps?

A Progressive Web App is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser. PWAs have been designed to deliver an app-like experience with the broad reach of web applications.

#### Core Characteristics of PWAs

To qualify as a PWA, a website should be:

- **Progressive**: It should work for every user, regardless of browser choice, using progressive enhancement principles.
- **Responsive**: It should fit any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or forms yet to emerge.
- **Connectivity independent**: It should be accessible offline or on low-quality networks.
- **App-like**: It should feel like an app to the user with app-style interactions and navigation.
- **Fresh**: It should always be up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
- **Safe**: It should be served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and ensure content hasnâ€™t been tampered with.
- **Discoverable**: It should be identifiable as an "application" thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope, allowing search engines to find it.
- **Re-engageable**: It should make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.
- **Installable**: It allows users to "keep" apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.
- **Linkable**: It can easily be shared via a URL and does not require complex installation.

#### Service Workers

A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. It's a key technology behind PWAs, enabling them to function offline and perform background tasks.

Service workers act as a proxy between your web app and the outside world. They can intercept network requests and cache or retrieve resources from the cache, making PWAs incredibly fast and reliable, even in flaky network conditions.

#### The Web App Manifest

The web app manifest is a simple JSON file that gives you, the developer, the ability to control how your app appears to the user in areas where they would typically see apps (e.g., mobile device home screen), direct what they can launch, and define its appearance at launch.

Manifest properties include start_url, display, background_color, theme_color, and icons, enabling control over the user's launch experience.

#### Building a PWA

To build a Progressive Web App, you will need to:

1. Ensure your site is responsive and that it works on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
2. Make your site work offline by implementing service workers.
3. Include a web app manifest with your application to add it to a user's home screen.
4. Provide an engaging experience, with fast loading, search engine optimization, and re-engagement features like push notifications if applicable.
5. Implement the use of HTTPS to ensure the security and privacy of your users.

#### Testing PWAs

You can test your PWA by using Chrome DevTools. The 'Audit' panel provides a "Progressive Web App" checkbox that conducts a series of tests and generates a report to let you know what is, and isn't, PWA compliant.

#### Conclusion

PWAs represent a powerful blend of web and mobile app features, harnessing the capabilities of modern browsers and the benefits of the mobile experience. As internet access and mobile device usage continue to grow worldwide, PWAs are becoming increasingly important. By applying PWA principles, developers can build web applications that feel just like native apps, providing a high-quality user experience that works for every user, regardless of their device or network conditions.
